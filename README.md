The Odin Project: [Foundations - Calculator](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator)

Note: the calculator for this project is supposed to evaluate an expression from left to right, not with the typical order of operations.
From the project page: "12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = should yield 42"
